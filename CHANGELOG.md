# Changelog

All notable changes to MacMonitor are documented here.

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-09

### Fixed

- **Fan control actually works now.** The 1.1.0 implementation wrote SMC keys in-process, which
  macOS silently rejects (`kIOReturnNotPrivileged`) on every current release — reads never
  needed elevated privilege, but writes always have. Fan control now installs a small helper
  tool (one-time admin approval, setuid root) and drives fan writes through it instead. No more
  repeat password prompts after the first grant.
- Fixed a broken DMG code signature from the ad-hoc Release build (Gatekeeper reported it as
  "damaged"); the packaging script now re-signs ad-hoc after building.
- Release workflow is now manually triggered instead of tag-triggered, so a bad build doesn't
  auto-publish.
- Updated install docs for Homebrew dropping `--no-quarantine`.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- **Fan control**: force fans to a target speed (30–100%) instead of relying on macOS's automatic
  curve. Works on Intel and Apple Silicon (best-effort on Apple Silicon, since the SMC firmware
  doesn't officially expose manual control there). Always fails safe back to Auto — on toggling
  off, on app quit, and automatically if any sensor reaches a critical temperature (100°C).

### Changed

- Softened the thermal-state and history-graph fill colors and rounded card corners for a less
  saturated, more legible look at a glance.
- Redesigned `MetricCard`/`MetricProgressBar` styling shared across the Thermal, CPU, Memory, and
  Storage cards.

## [1.0.0] - Initial release

- Thermal, CPU, and memory monitoring in the menu bar.
- Storage monitoring and per-value menu-bar toggles.
- Launch-at-login, notifications, and update checking.
